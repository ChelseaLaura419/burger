Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, they can choose to add it to the menu (left side of the page) or eat it (right side of the page).

Each burger on the menu has an Eat Now button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Users can also choose to throw their burger away if they don't feel it meets restaurant standards
