Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, they can choose to add it to the menu on the left side of the page or eat it and it will appear in the right side of the page.

Each burger on the menu has an Eat Now button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Once the burger has been eaten, users can choose to make the same burger again or throw their burger away if they feel it doesn't meets restaurant standards.
